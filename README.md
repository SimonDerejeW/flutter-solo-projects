## 1) Flutter Todo App with Hive & Slidable

User-friendly Todo App.
If you're looking to keep track of your daily tasks with a pinch of animation and a dash of high performance, you've landed in the right place. This app not only lets you add and manage your everyday todos but also packs a delightful punch with swipe-to-delete functionality, all while providing lightning-fast data persistence powered by Hive.

## Features 🚀

- **Add Todos**: Tap your tasks into existence and see them neatly listed in your app.
- **Mark as Complete**: Done with a task? Just check it off! Our intuitive checkbox system lets you track your progress.
- **Swipe to Delete**: Swipe right to bid farewell to tasks you no longer need to see. It’s satisfying and decluttering!
- **Local Storage with Hive**: Your todos stay with you forever (or until you delete them), thanks to Hive’s super-fast local storage.

## Getting Started 🏁

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine. If not, head over to [Flutter's official installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
